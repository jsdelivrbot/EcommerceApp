Ionic App Base
=====================

A starting project for Ionic that optionally supports using custom SCSS.

## Using this project

Using the Ionic CLI would help a lot:

To install ionic:

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic
```

After it is installed, just make sure it's in your PATH.

In order to build our project:

First install 'ios' as a platform (make sure you are in the 'Drop' directory):

```bash
$ ionic platform add ios
```

After 'ios' is installed, type the following commands:

```bash
$ ionic build ios
$ ionic run ios
```
